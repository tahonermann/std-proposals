<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>
SG21 attained strong concensus to forward
<a title="Contracts for C++"
   href="https://wg21.link/p2900r6">
P2900R6 (Contracts for C++)</a>
<sup><a title="Contracts for C++"
        href="#ref_p2900r6">[P2900R6]</a></sup>
to EWG during the
<a href="https://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21telecons2024/Teleconference2024-02-29">2024-02-29 SG21 telecon</a>
as its design for a minimally viable solution for contracts in C++.
This design does not integrate the traditional C assert facility, nor does it
expose interfaces to enable other traditional or ad hoc assert facilities to
integrate with the new contracts features.
</p>

<p>
The P2900R6 design includes a new <tt>contract_assert</tt> statement that avoids
many of the well-known pitfalls inherent in macro based traditional assert
facilities.
Despite considerable desire and effort to enable use of the <tt>assert</tt>
identifier in the contracts design, no method to do so was identified that both
avoided backward compatibility problems and used a syntax that gained
consensus.
<a title="assert Should Be A Keyword In C++26"
   href="https://wg21.link/p2884r0">

        href="#ref_p2884r0">[P2884R0]</a></sup>
attempted to promote <tt>assert</tt> to a keyword, but failed to get consensus.
<a title="A natural syntax for Contracts"
   href="https://wg21.link/p2961r2">
P2961R2 (A natural syntax for Contracts)</a>
<sup><a title="A natural syntax for Contracts"
        href="#ref_p2961r2">[P2961R2]</a></sup>,
was approved by SG21 during the
<a href="https://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21kona2023/SG21">Kona, 2023 meeting</a>.
Section 5.2, "The <tt>assert</tt> name clash", details the challenges faced with
trying to repurpose that identifier.
</p

<p>
As a core language feature, <tt>contract_assert</tt> does not provoke ODR
violations due to <tt>NDEBUG</tt> being inconsistently defined across
translation units, is not subject to being redefined during translation as is
permissible for macros (note that <tt>contract_assert</tt> is proposed as a
keyword and is therefore not available for use as an identifier), and is not
confused by the presence of a comma that is not contained within a pair of
balanced parenthesis (an issue addressed for C assert by
<a title="Make assert() macro user friendly for C and C++"
   href="https://wg21.link/p2264r7">
P2264R7 (Make assert() macro user friendly for C and C++)</a>
<sup><a title="Make assert() macro user friendly for C and C++"
        href="#ref_p2264r7">[P2264R7]</a></sup>
for C++26).
<tt>contract_assert</tt> also guards against some cases of possibly unintended
behavior that may otherwise occur when its associated
<a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.cond"><em>conditional-expression</em></a>
is evaluated.
It guards against possibly unintended mutation of some objects by implicitly
applying a const qualifier to the result of
<a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.prim.id.general"><em>id-expression</em></a>s
that name a parameter or variable with automatic storage duration and to the
pointee type of
<a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.prim.this"><em>this</em> expression</a>s.
It guards against unintended dependence on side effects by allowing an
implementation to elide evaluation when the result of the evaluation can be
predetermined or to perform the evaluation multiple times (with an expectation
that multiple evaluations will make such side effects more noticeable).
</p>

<p>
The differences between <tt>contract_assert</tt> and traditional assert
facilities make it impossible to directly reimplement traditional assert
facilities using <tt>contract_assert</tt> as currently proposed without imposing
potentially extensive changes to code that uses those facilities.
Further, the latter two behaviors (implicit application of a const qualifier
and evaluation elision or duplication) have become contentious due to a lack of
confidence that <tt>contract_assert</tt>, as currently proposed, suffices as
a modern alternative to traditional assert facilities like C assert.
</p>

<p>
Proposed are extensions to the P2900R6 design that are intended to enable
existing assert facilities, including C assert, to be optionally integrated
with C++ contracts, with minimal changes, such that assertion failures that
occur through use of those facilities are also reported through the C++
contract violation handler.
In doing so, the author hopes to reduce the current contention over the design
of <tt>contract_assert</tt> by allowing those that prefer the traditional
evaluation and side effect guarantees to use interfaces that behave as they
desire without compromising on the protections that <tt>contract_assert</tt>, as
currently proposed, provides.
</p>


<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>
Vast amounts of code have been written over the lifetime of the C and C++
languages that utilize C assert or other traditional or ad hoc assertion
facilities.
It is not realistic to expect or require existing uses of traditional assert
facilities to be rewritten to use C++ contracts when such code is migrated to
C++26.
The limitations and pitfalls of traditional assert facilities provides good
motivation for a new modern facility.
However, greater motivation for use of a new facility is produced if it enables
integration with existing facilities (such integration also helps to reduce the
negative consequences of the infamous
<a href="https://xkcd.com/927">"there are N+1 competing standards"</a>
situation).
Specifically, the consequences of use of multiple assertion facilities, a
persistent reality for many programmers, is reduced if assertion failures can
be handled in a uniform way.
</p>

<p>
While it is not feasible to unconditionally claim the <tt>assert</tt> identifier
for use with C++ contracts without unacceptable backward compatibility impact,
it is feasible to offer the ability for projects to opt-in to a mode that
handles assertion failures in traditional <tt>assert()</tt> expressions by
invoking the C++ contract violation handler.
In the long term, perhaps with assistance from code modernization tools, such
integration could become standard practice and eventually allow <tt>assert</tt>
to be more fully integrated into C++ contracts.
</p>


<h1 id="design">Design considerations</h1>


<h2 id="design-handler">Invoking the contract violation handler</h2>

<p>
There are two basic approaches to enable a traditional assert facility to
invoke the contract violation handler.
<ul>
  <li>Expose an interface to call <tt>::handle_contract_violation()</tt> with
      a user constructed <tt>std::contracts::contract_violation</tt> object,
      or</li>
  <li>Expose a core language feature that evaluates an arbitrary expression and
      then calls <tt>::handle_contract_violation()</tt> with an appropriately
      constructed <tt>std::contracts::contract_violation</tt> object if that
      evaluation yields a false result.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Enabling user construction of <tt>std::contracts::contract_violation</tt>
objects would require exposing a suitable constructor or factory function to
specify property values to be returned by the various property access member
functions.
<tt>std::contracts::contract_violation</tt> is designed to allow these property
values to be accessed from statically allocated memory associated with each
contract assertion present in the program that has a potentially checked
semantic.
Support for user construction would require specifying an ownership model for
user provided values.
Further, it is currently implementation-defined whether the class is
polymorphic; it could be an abstract class, but the property access member
functions are non-virtual.
Enabling user construction could provide flexibility for integration of
traditional assert facilities with C++ contracts, but would also impose
responsibility for appropriate selection of the <tt>contract_kind</tt>,
<tt>contract_semantic</tt>, and <tt>detection_mode</tt> property values.
</p>

<p>
<tt>contract_assert</tt> is a core language feature that is already capable of
evaluating an expression and invoking the contract violation handler.
The inability to use it to directly implement a traditional assert interface is
superimposed by the express desire to avoid well known problems with those
traditional interfaces.
However, it is possible to relax those imposed restrictions.
</p>

<p>
The grammar for the <tt>contract_assert</tt> statement was designed with
future extension in mind.
<blockquote class="quote">
<em>assertion-statement :</em>
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
<tt>contract_assert</tt> <em>attribute-specifier-seq<sub>opt</sub></em> <tt>(</tt> <em>conditional-expression</em> <tt>)</tt> <tt>;</tt>
</div>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
While use of an attribute to opt-in to alternative semantics for the
<tt>contract_assert</tt> statement would not require syntactic extension, such
use would violate the WG21 ignorability policy for standard attributes.
The ignorability policy prohibits a standard attribute from selecting a
behavior that is not one of the permissible behaviors an implementation would be
allowed to select in the absence of the attribute; an attribute cannot be used
to relax constraints.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, there is room for context sensitive keywords to be used in between
the <tt>contract_assert</tt> keyword and the opening parenthesis (either before
or after the optional <em>attribute-specifier-seq</em>) or between the closing
parenthesis and the semicolon.
</p>


<h2 id="design-ndebug">Interaction with <tt>NDEBUG</tt></h2>

<p>
C assert supports two translation modes.
When the <tt>NDEBUG</tt> macro is defined, arguments to <tt>assert</tt>
expressions are not evaluated; this is the traditional form of the
<em>ignore</em> semantic (and a form that leads to ODR violations).
When <tt>NDEBUG</tt> is not defined, <tt>assert</tt> exhibits behavior like
that of the <em>enforce</em> semantic, but with more stringent requirements on
how termination is performed; <tt>abort()</tt> is called and any further
processing requires the installation of a signal handler for the
<tt>SIGABRT</tt> signal.
</p>

<p>
Since <tt>NDEBUG</tt> may be used to conditionally remove code that an
<tt>assert</tt> expression depends on, it isn't possible, in general, to
parse arguments passed to <tt>assert</tt> when <tt>NDEBUG</tt> is defined.
It is therefore impossible to use <tt>NDEBUG</tt> as a proxy for a contract
semantic; when <tt>NDEBUG</tt> is defined, no contract specification is
present.
However, when <tt>NDEBUG</tt> is not defined, then all contract semantics
are applicable, though maintaining conformance with C standard requirements
for the behavior of <tt>assert</tt> requires selecting the <em>enforce</em>
semantic, writing the required information to the standard error stream,
and calling <tt>abort()</tt>.
</p>


<h1 id="proposal">Proposal</h1>

<h2 id="proposal-traditional-semantics">Extend traditional semantics to
                                        <tt>contract_assert</tt></h2>

<p>
Add a new <tt>traditional_assert</tt> enumerator to
<tt>std::contracts::contract_kind</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Extend the <tt>contract_assert</tt> syntax to allow an optional
context sensitive <tt>traditional</tt> keyword after <tt>contract_assert</tt>.
<blockquote class="quote">
<em>assertion-statement :</em>
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
<tt>contract_assert</tt> <ins><tt>traditional</tt><sub><em>opt</em></sub> </ins><em>attribute-specifier-seq<sub>opt</sub></em> <tt>(</tt> <em>conditional-expression</em> <tt>)</tt> <tt>;</tt>
</div>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Modify the <tt>contract_assert</tt> behavior as follows when
<tt>traditional</tt> is specified.
<ul>
  <li>Do not implicitly apply const qualification to parameters, variables
      with automatic storage duration, or the pointee type of
      <tt>this</tt>.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the <em>conditional-expression</em> exactly one time each time
      control reaches the <tt>contract_assert</tt> statement irregardless
      of implementation-defined selection of contract semantics.</li>
  <li>Propagate exceptions thrown during evaluation of the
      <em>conditional-expression</em>; do not catch them and invoke the
      violation handler.</li>
  <li>If the <em>conditional-expression</em> evaluation yields a false result,
      invoke the violation handler with a reference to a
      <tt>std::contracts::contract_violation</tt> object for which
      its <tt>detection_mode()</tt> member will return <tt>predicate_false</tt>,
      its <tt>kind()</tt> member will return <tt>traditional_assert</tt>, and
      its <tt>semantic()</tt> member will return <tt>enforce</tt>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Extend the recommended practice for the default contract violation handler
to implement the behavior required by the C standard for a failed assertion
when invoked with a <tt>contract_violation</tt> object whose <tt>kind()</tt>
member returns <tt>traditional_assert</tt>.
This includes writing select information to the standard error stream and
then calling <tt>abort()</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Note that the above calls for the violation handler to be invoked with the
<em>enforce</em> contract semantic in effect.
This is required because there is no mechanism for the <tt>contract_assert</tt>
statement to indicate whether the <em>conditional-expression</em> was
evaluated, what its result was, or whether the violation handler was
invoked and returned.
Code following the <tt>contract_assert</tt> statement therefore has no
information available to determine what action should be taken next.
This limitation can be worked around by evaluating the assertion predicate
separately and using the result value for the <em>conditional-expression</em>
of the <tt>contract_assert</tt> statement, but this effectively hides the
expression from the contracts implementation and prevents exposing
it via the <tt>comment()</tt> member of
<tt>std::contracts::contract_violation</tt>.
Should motivation arise, additional extensions to enable use of an alternative
contract semantic can be added at a later time.
Selection of an alternate semantic could be enabled by parameterizing
<tt>traditional</tt> with an argument enclosed in angle brackets (e.g.,
<tt>traditional&lt;observe&gt;</tt>; use of parenthesis would be ambiguous due
to the parenthesis that surround the <em>conditional-expression</em>).
</p>


<h2 id="proposal-assert-opt-in">Enable optional C++ contracts integration for C
                                assert</h2>

<p>
Upon inclusion of the <tt>assert.h</tt> or <tt>cassert</tt> header, if
the <tt>NDEBUG</tt> macro is not defined and the
<tt>ASSERT_USES_CONTRACTS</tt> macro is defined,
define the <tt>assert</tt> macro as follows.
<blockquote class="code">
#define assert(...) \
  [&amp;] { contract_assert traditional (__VA_ARGS__); }()
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Note that it is not an error to define both <tt>NDEBUG</tt> and
<tt>ASSERT_USES_CONTRACTS</tt>; when <tt>NDEBUG</tt> is defined,
<tt>ASSERT_USES_CONTRACTS</tt> has no effect.
The effects of the <tt>NDEBUG</tt> macro must take precedence to preserve
backward compatibility with existing code.
