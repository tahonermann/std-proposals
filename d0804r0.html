<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>
This paper provides a detailed description of the motivation for the concern
expressed in comment US/001 of the PDTS 21544 collated comments document
<sup><a title="ISO_IEC PDTS 21544 - JTC001-SC22-N5233 Collated Comments"
        href="#ref_pdts_comments">
[PDTS_comments]</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following program that utilizes features from the
<a title="Working Draft, Extensions to C++ for Modules"
   href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/n4667.pdf">
Modules TS</a>
<sup><a title="Working Draft, Extensions to C++ for Modules"
        href="#ref_n4667">
[N4667]</a></sup>
and a modularized standard library implemented as specified by
<a title="Standard Library Modules"
   href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2017/p0581r0.pdf">
P0581R0</a>
<sup><a title="Standard Library Modules"
        href="#ref_p0581r0">
[P0581R0]</a></sup>.  The code defines a module (<tt>foo</tt>) that utilizes
entities imported from a dependent standard library module (<tt>std.core</tt>)
and a user provided module (<tt>bar</tt>).
</p>

<fieldset>
  <legend>foo.cpp</legend>
<pre><code class="c++">module foo;

import std.core;
import bar;

export std::vector&lt;widget&gt; get_some_widgets() {
  /* ... */
}
</code></pre>
</fieldset>

<fieldset>
  <legend>bar.cpp</legend>
<pre><code class="c++">module bar;

export class widget { /* ... */ };
</code></pre>
</fieldset>

<p>
The following build commands exemplify those required to build the example
using Microsoft's implementation of the Modules TS.  Note that the order of the
invocations is significant; the module interface unit of module <tt>bar</tt>
(<tt>bar.cpp</tt>) must be compiled before the module interface unit of module
<tt>foo</tt> (<tt>foo.cpp</tt>) as the latter requires the existence of the
module artifact (<tt>bar.ifc</tt>) produced by the compilation of
<tt>bar.cpp</tt>.
</p>

<fieldset>
  <legend>Build commands</legend>
<pre><code class="cmd">rem Compiling bar.cpp produces bar.ifc and bar.obj.
cl /EHsc /MD /std:c++latest /c bar.cpp /experimental:module /module:interface
rem Compiling foo.cpp produces foo.ifc and foo.obj.
cl /EHsc /MD /std:c++latest /c foo.cpp /experimental:module /module:interface /module:reference bar.ifc
</code></pre>
</fieldset>

<p>
Now consider what is necessary for a <tt>C++</tt> tool to consume the source
code above.  Historically, <tt>C++</tt> tools have required some amount of
configuration to handle preprocessor state; macro definitions and header
search paths for example.  Once configured, access to the source code (and
potentially, support for some language extensions) is all that is needed to
successfully parse the source code.
</p>

<p>
The Modules TS adds additional requirements not previously needed in order to
successfully parse source code.  With an example like the one above, access
to the source code and preprocessor configuration alone no longer suffices.
The tool must now be able to resolve module import declarations to either the
source code for the corresponding module interface unit, or to some module
artifact that provides the exported entities for the module.
</p>

<p>
Assuming an implementation strategy similar to Microsoft's, the following
capabilities and information must be available either directly in the tool
or in a script or build system that invokes the tool:
<ul>
  <li>The ability to produce and consume module artifacts containing module
      export information.</li>
  <li>The transitive set of all dependent modules for each translation unit
      to be processed, the source code for each module interface unit and
      its included headers, the preprocessor options and language dialect
      options necessary to compile each module interface unit, and an order
      in which to build each module interface unit so that dependent module
      artifacts are available as needed.</li>
  <li>The ability to map a module import declaration to a module artifact.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This information may be difficult and costly to obtain and maintain,
particularly when deep module hierarchies are present or when module
dependencies are platform dependent (consider a standard library implementation
that imports implementation specific modules in the source code for its
public facing module interface units).
</p>

<p>
Though module artifact are not intended to be a distribution format or an
alternative to access to source code, motivation exists to use them in this
way.  At least one large company is in the process of modularizing its source
code (not currently using the Modules TS) in order to reduce overhead in its
distributed build system by distributing module artifacts in lieu of source
code.  This is clearly problematic for tool providers since, without access to
the source code, compilation is impossible.
</p>

<p>
Many <tt>C++</tt> tools do not supply their own standard library.  Other tools,
such as static analyzers, realize their maximum value when they are able to make
use of the standard library of a particular compiler provider.  Source code
is often dependent upon a particular implementation of the standard library
and can't be successfully parsed with other implementations.  For these reasons,
many tools are dependent on interoperability with standard libraries provided
by other providers; providing their own modularized standard library is not
a feasible option.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of this paper looks at potential options for integrating a tool
with a modularized code base.
</p>

<h1 id="integration">Integration strategies</h1>

<h2 id="int_consume">Consume a module artifact from another provider</h2>

<p>
Module artifact formats (e.g., the <tt>bar.ifc</tt> and <tt>foo.ifc</tt>
files above) fall outside the scope of the Modules TS; they are implementation
details if they exist at all.  Microsoft is currently using the
<a title="Compiler-neutral Internal Program Representation for C++"
   href="https://github.com/GabrielDosReis/ipr">
open source IPR project</a>
<sup><a title="Compiler-neutral Internal Program Representation for C++"
        href="#ref_ipr">
[IPR]</a></sup> which, in theory, could allow tools to consume Microsoft's
module artifact files, though there are no backward compatibility promises.
To be fair, Microsoft has been clear that their implementation of the Modules
TS is experimental, so such promises are not expected at this time.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft does make the source code to its standard library implementation
available, so, in theory, a tool could construct its own module artifacts
from it.  As of the Visual Studio 2017 release, Microsoft does not appear
to provide source code for the module interface units distributed
with the product, nor is a build system for compiling the standard library
provided.
</p>

<p>
When asked about the potential for tools to consume Microsoft generated
module artifacts, Gabriel Dos Reis provided the following statement on
behalf of Microsoft.
<div style="margin-left: 2em; border-style: solid; background-color: lemonchiffon">
We thank you for sharing an early draft of your paper.   Tooling, especially
semantics-aware development tools, that supports sound and scalable C++
software architecture practice is at the heart of Microsoft's efforts behind
the C++ modules proposal.  Microsoft is a producer and a huge consumer of C++
technologies and tools, including third party and open source components.
Microsoft is fully committed to opening up its compiled module interface
binary format and tooling regarding C++ modules, and encourages the larger
C++ community to coalesce around shared formats or library APIs or conversion
protocols.  Microsoft will address the specific points raised in this draft
document in a separate WG21 document.  Modules represent an unprecedented
opportunity for the C++ community to up its game regarding tooling, and we
hope the community seizes it for the greater good of all of us.
</div>
</p>

<p>
It isn't yet known what module artifact formats other implementors may choose,
but it seems unlikely that all implementors will converge on a single portable
format.  In particular, it seems likely that Clang would use the existing,
optimized, non-portable format it currently uses for pre-compiled headers and
Clang's own module system.  For these reasons, even if it turns out that
consuming Microsoft's module artifact files is a feasible solution, that
solution is unlikely to be feasible for all compiler providers.
</p>

<p>
The effort required to consume a module artifact and translate the information
contained within it to a given tool's internal data representation may also be
prohibitively expensive.  A module artifact must be able to represent nearly
the entirety of the C++ language; translating that information to another form
is likely to be a significant effort.
</p>

<p>
Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>Access to the module interface unit source code is <em>not</em>
      required.</li>
  <li>Module artifact formats must be public, stable, extensible, etc...</li>
</ul
</p>

<h2 id="int_translate">Translate a module artifact from another provider</h2>

<p>
Similar to direct consumption, another approach would be to translate a module
artifact from another provider, for example, to generate source code that
could be compiled to produce a module artifact in another format.
</p>

<p>
If compiler providers were to provide a tool capable of such generation, it
would obviate the need for each tool provider to be able to directly consume
module artifacts from every compiler provider.  Ideally, compiler providers
would collaborate to define a common interface each could implement.
</p>

<p>
Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>Access to the module interface unit source code is <em>not</em>
      required.</li>
  <li>Tools must be available to consume a module artifact and generate
      (portable standards compliant with exceptions for exported entities
      that use language extensions) source code suitable for compilation as a
      module interface unit.</li>
</ul
</p>

<h2 id="int_observe">Build observation</h2>

<p>
It is possible for a tool to discover modules by observing a build system in
action.  Upon invocation of a recognized compiler, the command line for the
invocation could be analyzed, its mode (preprocess-only, translate, produce
a pre-compiled header, produce a module artifact, etc...) determined, and
actions taken to replicate that action as necessary.
</p>

<p>
For example, for the build commands provided above, a tool could observe
the first invocation (for <tt>bar.cpp</tt>), discover that the command line
includes <tt>/module:interface</tt>, and then use other information provided
on the command line to determine how to compile <tt>bar.cpp</tt> so as to
build its own module artifact for later consumption.  When the second
invocation (for <tt>foo.cpp</tt>) is then observed, pending any errors, the
dependent module artifacts will be available to facilitate translation (and
production of an additional module artifact for importers of module
<tt>foo</tt>).
</p>

<p>
This is a technically challenging, non-portable solution that requires deep
platform-specific integration and compiler-specific support.
</p>

<p>
This approach fails when the compilation of needed module interface units
is not observed.
</p>

<p>
Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>Access to module interface unit source code.</li>
  <li>The ability to recognize and understand compiler invocations.</li>
  <li>Module artifact generation must be observed during the build<br/>
      (This is unlikely to be the case for standard library modules)</li>
  <li>In a distributed build environment, requires any module artifacts
      produced by the tool to also be distributed (or rebuilt).</li>
</ul
</p>

<h2 id="int_build">Build system duplication</h2>

<p>
Assuming a tool has support for producing and consuming module artifacts,
it would be possible to script invoking the tool for each needed module.  This
likely amounts to duplicating a portion of an existing build system that
already supports one or more compilers or tools.
</p>

<p>
Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>Access to module interface unit source code, including those for
      standard library modules.</li>
  <li>The preprocessor options, language dialect options, etc... needed to
      translate each module interface unit.</li>
  <li>In a distributed build environment, requires any module artifacts
      produced by the tool to also be distributed (or rebuilt).</li>
</ul
</p>

<h2 id="int_prohibit">Prohibit use of module features</h2>

<p>
This is the status quo.  Tool providers can elect not to support modularized
source code.
</p>

<p>
This may not be such a confrontational stance to take.  Some tools only require
access to a portion of a code base.  For example common uses of
<a title="Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator"
   href="http://www.swig.org">
SWIG</a>
<sup><a title="Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator"
        href="#ref_swig">
[SWIG]</a></sup> require just a few translation units and their headers.
Frequently, the preprocessor can be used to further restrict necessary
dependencies.  It is conceivable that conditional compilation could
suffice for many use cases.  However, such a stance would likely become
increasingly difficult to maintain; especially as pressure increases to
modularize the lowest level of dependencies, such as the standard library.
</p>

<p>
Support for a partially modularized code base would likely require resolution
of comment US/002 of the PDTS 21544 collated comments document
<sup><a title="ISO_IEC PDTS 21544 - JTC001-SC22-N5233 Collated Comments"
        href="#ref_pdts_comments">
[PDTS_comments]</a></sup> to ensure compatibility between translation units
that access the same entities via module exports vs declarations in the
global module.
</p>

<p>
Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>A non-modularized source code base.</li>
</ul
</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>

<p>
These challenges for tool providers pose a problem for the adoption of modules
as specified by the Modules TS.  Likewise, if adoption of the Modules TS is
high, the difficulty in providing support for modularized code bases could
result in a chilling effect on the development of new tools unless convenient
methods are found to address the integration concerns described here.
</p>
 
<p>
It isn't clear how, or if, these challenges can be addressed within the
<tt>C++</tt> standard given that build systems and implementation strategies
can not realistically be prescribed.  As a result, this paper offers no
particular solutions for the concerns it raises.
</p>

<p>
These challenges suggest that a module system like
<a title="Clang Documentation: Modules"
   href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Modules.html">
Clang's</a>
<sup><a title="Clang Documentation: Modules"
        href="#ref_clang_modules">
[Clang_Modules]</a></sup> that implements module support as an optimization
with transparent fallback to traditional headers might be a better fit for the
<tt>C++</tt> community as a whole.  On the other hand, Clang's module system
does not (currently) reduce dependence on the preprocessor; a desirable goal of
the design specified in the Modules TS.  In theory, it seems possible to design
a module import syntax that does not directly use preprocessor directives, but
that allows import declarations to be satisfied by module artifacts (if
available) or via transformation to preprocessor include directives otherwise
(complete with all the macro fun that implies).  But that would be the subject
matter of a different paper.
